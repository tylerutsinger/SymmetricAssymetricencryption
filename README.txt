Python example of using symmetric encryption to encrypt a txt file
and then using RSA asymmetric encryption to generate a public and private key to encrypt the key generated during the symmetric encryption process. 
Then being able to decrypt the RSA public key with the private key.






All keys will be saved to the folder once the program is ran. In order to run project 2 the key from project
1 will have to be generated by running project 1. Project 1 is Symmetric encryption 
and project 2 is Asymetric encryption. 

NOTE: the location of the copy of the key from project 1 will have to be changed if this program is run on your 
personal machine due to us not saving in same path.
